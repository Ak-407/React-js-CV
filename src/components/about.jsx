 </header>
 <div className='Th3'>
 <h3>As a young individual, I was introduced to the world of technology through my first Windows laptop. However, I found that I was not particularly interested in the typical activities such as gaming that many of my peers were engaged in. It was not until I was introduced to the powerful operating system, Kali Linux, by a friend who is now a full stack web developer, that I truly discovered my passion for technology. Through utilizing Kali Linux, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of technology and the potential it holds. I found myself drawn to activities such as cracking passwords and phishing, as well as exploring the dark web. It was through these experiences that I came to realize that computer engineering was the field that aligns with my interests and skillset. This led to my decision to pursue a career in computer engineering.</h3>

Face fear and progress.
</h1>
<h4 className='H42'>
It can be daunting to take on a challenge or pursue a goal that may seem impossible, but sometimes it is necessary to push through our fear and take a leap of faith in order to reach success. It is important to acknowledge our anxieties and anxieties, but not let them stop us from striving forward and achieving our goals. By confronting our fears and embracing the unknown, we can reach heights we did not think were possible.
